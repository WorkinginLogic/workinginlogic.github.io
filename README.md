## About Me

I'm passionate about expressing myself through various mediums, from visual art to writing code and composing music. With a background in all of these, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to my projects.

## Music

Music is a realm where I channel my creativity. Whether it's composing original pieces or experimenting with different genres, music allows me to explore new soundscapes and convey feelings that words alone can't capture.
